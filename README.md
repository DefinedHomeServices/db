### Architecture

The architecture used in this module provides several benefits:

1. Separation of Concerns
	FirebaseDBClient: Manages direct interactions with the Firestore database.
	FirebaseAPIClient: Defines an interface for creating customers, allowing for flexibility in implementation.
	CreateCustomerHandler: Handles the logic for creating customers using a client that implements the FirebaseAPIClient interface.

2. Flexibility and Extensibility
	The use of interfaces (FirebaseAPIClient) allows for different implementations of the customer creation logic. This makes it easy to switch out the database or add new methods without changing the core logic.

3. Testability
		By defining interfaces and separating the logic into different structs, it becomes easier to write unit tests. Mock implementations of FirebaseAPIClient can be used to test the CreateCustomerHandler without needing a real Firestore database.
4. Reusability
	The FirebaseDBClient and CreateCustomerHandler structs can be reused in different parts of the application or in other projects, promoting code reuse.

5. Maintainability
	The clear separation of responsibilities makes the code easier to maintain. Changes in one part of the code (e.g., database interactions) do not affect other parts (e.g., business logic).

6. Scalability
	The architecture allows for easy scaling. New methods and functionalities can be added to the FirebaseAPIClient interface and implemented in the FirebaseDBClient without affecting the existing code.

7. Error Handling
	Centralized error handling in the CreateCustomer method and HandleCreateCustomer method ensures that errors are managed consistently across the application.

8. Initialization and Configuration
	The NewFirebaseClient function handles the initialization and configuration of Firebase and Firestore, ensuring that the setup is done correctly and consistently.

Overall, this architecture promotes clean, modular, and maintainable code, making it easier to develop, test, and extend the application.
